<h3>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life</h3>
    <p><ul>

        <li>1941   -  Tries to enroll in the military after the pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the millitary asked his lab work  on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li>
        <li>1942   -  Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and plant pathology </li>
        <li> 1944  -   Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont,leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies 
                        to Mexicoto head a new plant pathology program. over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of 
                        disease resistent wheat- including different varieties for each major climate on earth </li> 
        <li>1945   -  Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, dobling wheat yields </li> 
        <li>1953   -  Crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with high-yielding American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. it goes on to provides
                         95% of Mexico's wheat. </li>
        <li>1962   -   Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly
                        expanding population </li> 
        <li>1970   -  receives the Nobel Peace Prize  </li> 
        <li> 1983   -  helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields </li>  
        <li> 1984   -  becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University </li> 
        <li>2005   -  states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can 
                         meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animal
                         for a long time.Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds." </li>  
        <li>2009   -  dies at th age of 95</li> 
    </ul>
